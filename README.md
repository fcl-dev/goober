### What is goober?

goober is a music player, written in Svelte and Rust. It's currently in the pre-alpha stage, a.k.a indev.

### What can goober play?

MP3, WAV, Vorbis, FLAC

### ~~Why does goober take longer amounts of time to scan bigger folders?~~

~~The algorithm goober uses stores album covers in AppData (differs in non-Windows platforms),
and that itself takes some time. goober is constantly being improved in newer versions.~~

As of the closing of issue #1, goober's algorithm is now much faster and I wouldn't consider it slow.
If you found a good way to improve it further, feel free to submit a PR.

### When will goober get released?

When I deem it semi-usable. Can't give an ETA, but you're free to try it yourself. I'm using it as a music player while I'm building it.
