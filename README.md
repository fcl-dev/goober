### What is goober?

goober is a music player, written in Svelte and Rust. It's currently in the pre-alpha stage, a.k.a indev.

### What can goober play?

MP3, WAV, Vorbis, FLAC

### Why does goober take longer amounts of time to scan bigger folders?

The algorithm goober uses stores album covers in AppData (differs in non-Windows platforms),
and that itself takes some time. goober is constantly being improved in newer versions.
